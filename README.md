# repository-title-goes-here

This is a single file stand-alone application using R Markdown.

It was run and tested using RStudio and the knitr package.

Use the file with the .Rmd extension as input, or examine the
file with the .html extension to see what the output is like.

This program requires the following packages in R,

dplyr
ggplot2
magrittr
rstan

in particular, and there may be one or two others that I forgot
to document here.
